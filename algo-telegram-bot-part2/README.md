### A python-based telegram application that lets you interact with the Algorand blockchain from the telegram messaging UI
## Part 2 of the algo-telegram-bot  

In part 1, we created a connection.py file. Import the file in part 2:
  
  `git clone https://github.com/bobeu/algo-telegram-bot.git`
  `cd algo-telegram-bot`
  `cd algo-telegram-bot-part2`
  
In contrast, this part features more complex tasks such as taking input from users and signing transactions on Algorand blockchain.
